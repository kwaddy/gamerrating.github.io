            <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
            <p>
                My name is Gamer Kay and I am the creator of this website. I am a 23 year old college
                student who had to create this website for a class. I already enjoy working on websites,
                so this wasn't too difficult to implement. A little bit about myself is that I am a gamer
                who enjoys playing so many different types of games. I am also a bit of a small time
                streamer that goes by LilNightmare online! The games that I tend to like the best are
                multiplayer team based games like Overwatch and Apex. Even though I am not good at these
                games, I do enjoy playing the games and making new friends. I am also a bit of a small-time
                streamer that goes by iiAikoii. If you ever want to check me out, I do have an active
                <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/iiaikoii">twitch channel</a>. Here, you can watch me play some
                overwatch or directly contact me with any questions!

                <h3>Why Did I Do This?</h3>
                <p>
                    Like I mentioned earlier, I made this website for a college course, however, there is a bit of
                    a personal reason that I decided to create a website like this. Like many others across the world,
                    I enjoy playing video games, but it was always extremely hard to find out whether a game was good
                    or not from one specific resource. As such, I wanted to create a website that showcased reviews
                    from multiple different sources. Think of it as a scholarly resource for games. This way, when
                    people wish to look up and read about a game, they are able to see reviews from multiple different
                    game sites like steam or the playstation plus store without having to specifically go to those
                    websites. I also wanted to make something where others can leave reviews anonymously without 
                    having to attach their name to it at all. This may be cause for others to review bomb a specific game,
                    but since this is a small project for the time being, I am not worrying about the review bombing
                    just yet. I want to add ways for people to not just do text reviews, but upload video reviews as well.
                    This will open up the site to a lot more variable reviews, but that will come at a later date once I
                    work out the kinks of how to make sure that the reviews don't go into adult level ratings. This is a
                    passion project and I will continuously work and update this as much as I can.

            <p>
                You can ask me questions directly about the website at iiaikoiiofficial@gmail.com. My discord is also
                linked within my twitch to make it even easier for others to contact me.
